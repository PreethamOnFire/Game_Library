This app organizes all games on different platforms such as Xbox, Steam, Epic, etc. This makes it so the user does not need to open multiple launchers to play their games.

The user needs to add games manually using the expander on the right.
The games get added to the Main Menu screen and on the list on the left. 
The list on the left has a checkbox to keep track of which games are completed.
The user can click on the game either in the list or on the panels to get to the game page.
