# Game Library Launcher - WPF Application
![Logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41294885-7191-452f-97f9-4ab65d3a8706)

This app organizes all games on different platforms such as Xbox, Steam, Epic, etc. This makes it so the user does not need to open multiple launchers to play their games. 
## Main Screen

The user needs to add games manually using the expander on the right.
The games get added to the Main Menu screen and on the list on the left. 
The list on the left has a checkbox to keep track of which games are completed.
The user can click on the game either in the list or on the panels to get to the game page.
## Game page

This is a Game Page. It includes the game logo and a Play button to launch the game. 
It also has a collage of images and text that the user can add to using the plus button at the bottom.
Clicking the plus button shows opens a new window.

In this Window, the user can add an image, title, and additional content. Based on what content the user places or does not place the app will choose a template to use to display it in the collage. 

## Stuff for the Future
There are still some things I want to add and change. I want to add more templates to make the collage more varied. 
I want to add more features the give the user more control on how the collage is displayed.
There are also some styling things I want to look at for the launcher. 
I also want to change how images are stored in the application.
